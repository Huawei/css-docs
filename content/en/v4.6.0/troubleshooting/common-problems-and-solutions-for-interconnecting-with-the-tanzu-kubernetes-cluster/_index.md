This section describes the common problems and solutions for interconnecting with the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster. Currently, the following problems occur during interconnection with the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster:

-   A Pod cannot be created because the PSP permission is not created.
-   The mount point of the host is different from that of the native Kubernetes. As a result, a volume fails to be mounted.
-   The livenessprobe container port conflicts with the Tanzu vSphere port. As a result, the container restarts repeatedly.
