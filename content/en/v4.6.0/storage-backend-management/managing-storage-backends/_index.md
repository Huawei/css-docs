This section describes how to create a storage backend. Currently, you can create a backend based on the configured backend yaml file or the exported configmap.json file.

If you create a backend by adding a backend yaml file, configure the backend file by referring to  [Examples of Storage Backend Configuration Files in Typical Scenarios](/docs/storage-backend-management/managing-storage-backends/creating-a-storage-backend/examples-of-storage-backend-configuration-files-in-typical-scenarios).

If the exported configmap.json file exists, create a storage backend by referring to  [Creating a Storage Backend](/docs/storage-backend-management/managing-storage-backends/creating-a-storage-backend).
