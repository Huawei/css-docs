>-   When oceanctl is used to update storage backend information, only the storage backend password can be updated.
>-   If the backend account password is updated on the storage device, the CSI plug-in will retry due to login failures. As a result, the account may be locked. If the account is locked, change the password by referring to  [An Account Is Locked After the Password Is Updated on the Storage Device](/docs/troubleshooting/storage-backend-issues/an-account-is-locked-after-the-password-is-updated-on-the-storage-device).
