The storage backends associated with the PVC to be changed are HyperMetro storage backends. If they are not HyperMetro storage backends, configure them by following the instructions in  [Manually Updating a Storage Backend](/docs/storage-backend-management/managing-storage-backends/updating-a-storage-backend/manually-updating-a-storage-backend).
